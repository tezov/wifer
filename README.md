This project has been done with the same lib than Crypter. 

## How to install

- Download this project
- Download all the lib folder (lib_java / lib_java_android / pluginTezov) from [crypter](https://github.com/tezov/crypter_and_lib)
- Put the all the 4 folders in a single folder
- Open the app_wifer folder with android studio
- sync and build.

If you don't understand the folder strutures you need to comply, look the crypter project first [crypter](https://github.com/tezov/crypter_and_lib).



## What's powerful in there ?

I thing nothing. That's just a good example that show how to user the socket package from my java lib.
